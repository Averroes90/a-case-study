## Overview and Origin

Founded by tech excutives Benoît Dageville, Thierry Cruanes and Marcin Żukowski, [Snowflake Inc.](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) is a cloud-based data warehousing software as service company. Headquartered in Bozeman, Montana, the company was founded in 2012 and was publicly launched in October 2014 after two years of stealth mode operation. The company provides solutions that enables businesses to store and analyze large amounts of data in a highly scalable, secure, and efficient manner. The platform supports a wide range of data workloads, including data engineering, data lakes, data warehousing, data science, data applications, and data sharing. Snowflake's unique architecture allows customers to independently - and on demand -  scale separate compute and storage capabilities. This leads to cost-effectiveness and improved performance. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for organizations dealing with big data and those requiring advanced analytics capabilities, such as AI and machine learning ventures.

The following quote from the company's website illustrates some of their ongoing work on AI. 
> Snowflake is bringing generative AI into data, empowering teams to maximise the value of the data by identifying the right data points, assets, and insights.
>
> That’s why Snowflake has recently acquired three companies that are helping bring advanced AI and deep learning to the Data Cloud:
>
> - Neeva, a search company founded to make search even more intelligent at scale. Neeva created a unique and transformative search experience that leverages generative AI and other innovations to allow users to query and discover data in new ways.
> - Streamlit, which developers use as their go-to platform to experiment and build LLM-powered, generative AI apps.
> - Applica, which uses deep learning to sort information, regardless of data type.

Given AI is highly interwoven into the DNA of snowflake's operations, it is difficult to come up with an estimate of AI-specific independent spending with the company, however infromation on the entirety of Snowflake's substantial funding sheds some light into the scale and scope of their AI work. 

After coming out of stealth mode in 2014, It raised $26 million. This was followed by an additional $45 million in 2015 and another $100 million in April 2017. In January 2018, the company announced a $263 million financing round at a $1.5 billion valuation, making it a unicorn. On February 7, 2020, the company raised another $479 million and finally culminating in a highly anticipated IPO on September 16, 2020 raising $3.4 billion miking it one of the largest software IPOs in history. 

## Business Activities of Snowflake Inc. 

A massive cloud warehousing unicorn, Snowflake offers a wide variety of solutions to a plethora of different customers of all sizes and business fields. AI and ML are a mainsty of most of Snowflake's solitions. In this study I will be  Specifically focusing on LLMs 

### Snowflake for LLM-Enabled Machine Learning Applications
The Snowflake Data Cloud is designed to support and advance machine learning initiatives. As the pace of innovation quickens, Snowflake spearheads support for the next generation of AI-powered technologies.

When relevant data is spread across numerous source systems, looking for and requesting access to data significantly slows development. Snowflake provides a single point of access to a global network of trusted data. With Snowflake, you can bring nearly all data types into your model without complex pipelines and enjoy native support for structured, semi-structured (JSON, Avro, ORC, Parquet, or XML), and unstructured data. 

- **Build LLM-powered data apps**

  Data scientists no longer need to be tethered to a front-end developer to build intuitive, easy-to-use data apps. Using Streamlit, a pure-Python open-source application framework, data scientists can quickly and easily create beautiful, intuitive data applications. With Streamlit, Snowflake users can use LLMs to build apps with integrations to web-hosted LLM APIs using external functions and Streamlit as an interactive front end for LLM-powered apps.
  
- **Aggregate and analyze unstructured data**

  Unstructured data is one of the fastest-growing data types, but historically, there was no easy way to aggregate and analyze that data. To continue securely offering, discovering, and consuming all types of governed data, Snowflake acquired Applica, a purpose-built, multi-modal LLM for document intelligence.
  
- **Interactive data search**

  Snowflake’s recent acquisition of Neeva is accelerating data search through generative AI. It enables conversational paradigms for asking questions and retrieving information, allowing teams to discover precisely the right data point, data asset, or data insight.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this field?

While some may consider the company’s growth a bubble, Snowflake’s growth is backed by a solid business strategy. Its ability to innovate its product with a focus on key markets and retention of current clients give the company an advantage over its competitors.

Snowflake incorporates a consumption-based pricing strategy where customers only pay for the services they use. This pricing strategy is beneficial to companies with varying required data processing needs. It allows them to scale their spending when necessary and pull back during slow periods. Through this strategy, Snowflake can better gauge its client’s needs and improve its product offering while maintaining a smooth revenue cycle.

### Snowflake SWOT Analysis 

- **Strengths**
  - **Strong Customer Base:**
    
    Having an existing customer base is essential for Snowflake’s bottom line. Snowflake’s client base provides a consistent revenue cycle and allows the company to forecast more accurately. It boasts more than 100 clients with a trailing 12-month revenue gather of more than $1 million.

In 2021, it recorded annual revenue of $0.592 billion, a 123.63 percent increase year over year. It is not surprising to see the strong current market capitalization of $94.338 billion with such growth.
  
- **Weaknesses**
  - **Use case pricing strategy can be expensive:**
 
    While its use case pricing strategy is beneficial to its clients, it may be difficult for companies with varying needs. Data management costs are usually extrapolated over time and can be an additional cost that some businesses may not want to pay for. Many users need a simple solution that doesn’t involve complicated configurations.
    
  - **Limited product diversity:**
 
    With its heavy focus on data warehousing, Snowflake lacks product diversity. While it is a leading contender in the space, other companies such as Microsoft and Oracle provide more attractive features and come standard with solutions that care for most business needs. It’s not that Snowflake’s product offering is terrible; it just falls short compared to more competitive products.
    
- **Opportunities**
  - **Expansion in the Big Data market:**
 
    As businesses exponentially increase their data collection, they need big data solutions that can help them improve decision-making and grow their profit margins. With its recent acquisition of Cryptonumerics, Snowflake has expanded to offer this service, which provides anonymized datasets with quantifiable risks. This product offering will provide businesses with a competitive edge to make informed decisions.
    
  - **Strategic Acquisitions:**

    The Company has not been shy about its capitalistic intentions; its acquisition of Cryptonumerics is a prelude to more acquisitions in the coming years. Further, with its IPO and strong financials, it can now acquire more companies to expand its product offerings.
    
- **Threats**
  - **Competition:**
 
    Strong companies do not become strong without facing worthy opponents. Like all other product providers, Snowflake faces competition from its industry-leading competitors, including Oracle, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft. Snowflake lacks the diversity of products these companies provide and often comes in second place when necessary cross-cloud compatibility. However, Snowflake’s robust product offering and revolutionary data architecture, as well as its strategic acquisitions, attempts to reduce this gap and firmly place them as a front-runner in the industry.
    
  - **Early Winner’s Curse:**
 
    A strong IPO, solid first-year financials, and recognition from industry experts like Gartner put Snowflake in a unique position with high expectations. If these traditional metrics begin to falter, investors may show some skepticism and present the classic case of the early winner’s curse. It may not be the end of the world for Snowflake, but if it doesn’t meet these metrics, investors may sour on the company and diminish its reputation.
  
### Snowflake Competitor Analysis

The global Data Warehouse as a service (DWaaS) market size is set to grow at a CAGR of 22.3 percent to 12.9 billion by 2026. Snowflake is competing in a market with a clear opportunity for growth. This section analyzes some of the key players in this market, focusing on their competitive advantages and market share in different segments, financials, and product offerings.

- **Oracle ADW**

  Oracle is a multinational corporation that specializes in business software and cloud computing. Its success is primarily attributed to its good brand recognition, more comprehensive product range, and diversified revenue streams. Oracle boasts a market capitalization of $258.033 billion, with 2021 revenues totaling $40.5 billion. The company’s cloud services and licenses revenues increased by 5 percent to $28.7 billion in 2021.

While Oracle’s product diversity and comprehensive offerings give it a strong competitive edge, Snowflake is a strong competitor. Its innovative data architecture and solid financials place it as a major contender in the industry. According to Slintel, Snowflake controls 15.93 percent of the data warehousing market compared to 13.98 percent held by Oracle ADW.
This data indicates that while Oracle is an established company with profound brand recognition, it fails to use its capital and market influence in other segments to compete with up-and-coming startups like Snowflake. Not that Snowflake is a small startup; however, Oracle’s size and momentum make it an intimidating competitor.

- **Amazon Redshift**

  Amazon Redshift, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, is a cloud-based data warehouse that provides petabyte-scale data storage and analytics services. It delivers scalable, cost-effective data warehousing and analytic solutions. Through Amazon (AWS), businesses can scale database capacity easily to meet the demands of their applications.
  In Q1 2021, AWS generated $14.8 billion in revenues. This includes all cloud computing and hosting revenues. According to Slintel, Amazon Redshift controls $23.46 percent of the DWaaS market. While it enjoys Amazon’s massive revenue stream and brand recognition, Stitchdata considers Snowflake a better platform, especially when starting your data warehouse journey.

Competing in a DWaas market heavily influenced by Amazon.com presents opportunities and challenges for up-and-coming cloud aggregators like Snowflake. The opportunity lies in the fact that Amazon Redshift is a subsidiary of Amazon, meaning it can take advantage of its massive market influence. The challenge lies in the fact that it’s challenging to compete against Amazon’s established market presence.

- **Microsoft Azure Data Warehouse**

  Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and infrastructure created by Microsoft. Azure has evolved from its early beginnings as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud computing framework into a comprehensive suite of cloud services.

The Microsoft Azure Data Warehouse offers flexible, scalable, enterprise-grade cloud storage. It provides fast performance at lower costs than traditional data warehouses. In the cloud infrastructure market, Microsoft Azure controls about 22 percent of the market share. Although Snowflake is a small competitor in this segment, cloud infrastructure contributes a large chunk of Microsoft’s revenues.

In Q2 2021, Microsoft Azure’s revenue grew by 51 percent compared to Q2 2020. Although Microsoft doesn’t publish exact revenue figures, Azure contributes an overwhelming portion. Due to the sheer size of Microsoft’s market influence, its growth in cloud services will likely continue to expand.

- **Google BigQuery**

  Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse that uses Google’s large-scale data processing infrastructure. BigQuery provides fast query performance at lower costs than traditional data warehouses. It features server-less web service architecture that helps it compute and store massive amounts of data. In addition, in case of any scaling issues, BigQuery provides a fully automated elastic scaling feature.

As part of the larger Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery contributes to the robust growth of Google’s cloud services segment. In Q2 2021, Google cloud contributed $4.6 billion, representing 54 percent growth year over year. Data from Slintel indicates that Google BigQuerry has a 12.17 percent market share in the data warehousing market with about 4330 customers. 

BigQuerry stands out against Snowflake because it has an enormous market influence, combined with Google’s massive revenue stream. Snowflake must balance its unique selling points against Google’s existing brand recognition and revenue stream. Although Snowflake is a small competitor, its brand recognition and subscription model might help it stand out to customers.

## Results & reccomendations

Snowflake is a strong competitor in the data warehousing market with a unique focus on simplicity, transparency, flexibility, and scalability. Its transparent use-based pricing model could allow businesses to avoid paying for features that they don’t need. Its focus on simplicity makes it a reliable partner for data management.

Despite strong contention from industry leaders such as Teradata and Amazon Web Services, Snowflake could become a market leader in the data cloud space. Even with a strong IPO and strong financials, Snowflake’s future success will depend on its ability to maintain existing customers and attract new clients.
